            Hayden Carder grew up in the western suburbs of Chicago, IL. He
            completed his B.S. in Chemistry at University of Rochester. While at
            UR, he conducted research under Professor Benjamin Miller focusing
            on two unique project areas: the development/application of a
            label-free multiplex biosensor and the synthesis of RNA targeting
            molecules. While there, he served as a workshop leader in various
            chemistry classes for 3 years. Interested in the application of new
            methodologies for the synthesis of biomolecules, he attended MIT to
            pursue his Ph.D. under Professor Alison Wendlandt. Outside of
            chemistry, Hayden enjoys cooking and making furniture in his spare
            time.
