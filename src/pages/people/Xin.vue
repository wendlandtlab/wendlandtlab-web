        Hayden Carder grew up in the western suburbs of Chicago, IL. He
        completed his B.S. in Chemistry at University of Rochester. While at UR,
        he conducted research under Professor Benjamin Miller focusing on two
        unique project areas: the development/application of a label-free
        multiplex biosensor and the synthesis of RNA targeting molecules. While
        there, he served as a workshop leader in various chemistry classes for 3
        years. Interested in the application of new methodologies for the
        synthesis of biomolecules, he attended MIT to pursue his Ph.D. under
        Professor Alison Wendlandt. Outside of chemistry, Hayden enjoys cooking
        and making furniture in his spare time.
