            Yuan was born and raised in Guangzhou (Canton), China. After
            finishing high school, he went to Peking University Health Science
            Center where he obtained his bachelor degree in pharmaceutical
            science and master degree in medicinal chemistry. His master
            projects in Prof. Yanxing Jiaâ€™s group focused on the total syntheses
            of ergot alkaloids. Continuing his passion for total synthesis, he
            moved to the US in 2014 and performed graduate research in the group
            of Prof. Scott Snyder first at the Scripps Research Institute
            (Florida), and later at the University of Chicago where he
            accomplished the syntheses of multiple halogenated cyclic ether and
            meroterpenoid natural products. In 2020, Yuan joined the Wendlandt
            Group to explore radical-mediated transformations. Outside the lab,
            Yuan enjoys playing fingerstyle guitar, hiking and tasting great
            foods in the local restaurants or prepared by his girlfriend.
