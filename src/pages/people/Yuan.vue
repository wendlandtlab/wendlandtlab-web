            finishing high school, he went to Peking University Health Science
            Center where he obtained his bachelor degree in pharmaceutical

            of Prof. Scott Snyder first at the Scripps Research Institute
            (Florida), and later at the University of Chicago where he
            accomplished the syntheses of multiple halogenated cyclic ether and
            meroterpenoid natural products. In 2020, Yuan joined the Wendlandt
            Group to explore radical-mediated transformations. Outside the lab,
            Yuan enjoy playing fingerstyle guitar, hiking and tasting great
            foods in the local restaurants or prepared by his girlfriend.
